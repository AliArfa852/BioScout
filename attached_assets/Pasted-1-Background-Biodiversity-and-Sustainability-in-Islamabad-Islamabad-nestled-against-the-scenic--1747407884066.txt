1. Background: Biodiversity and Sustainability in Islamabad 
Islamabad, nestled against the scenic Margalla Hills National Park, is a unique blend of urban 
and natural ecosystems, home to a rich diversity of flora and fauna. From vibrant birdlife and 
mammals in the hills to diverse plant species in green spaces like Shakarparian and Rawal Lake, 
this region’s natural heritage is a treasure. However, urbanization and climate change pose 
significant threats to this biodiversity. Protecting these ecosystems aligns with the United 
Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 15 (Life on Land) and SDG 13 
(Climate Action). "BioScout Islamabad" leverages AI to empower communities to monitor and 
conserve local species, contributing to a sustainable future by fostering environmental 
awareness and data-driven conservation strategies. 
2. The Challenge: Build "BioScout Islamabad" 
Your challenge is to design and prototype "BioScout Islamabad," an AI-powered web platform 
that serves as a community-driven biodiversity database for Islamabad and surrounding 
ecological areas, featuring AI-assisted species identification and an intelligent Q&A system 
powered by Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). 
The platform should enable community members to submit biodiversity observations and learn 
about local species and ecosystems through AI-driven tools. Imagine your platform being used 
by schools, hikers, and conservationists in Islamabad to track species, report rare sightings, and 
inspire real-world environmental stewardship. Your goal is to create a tool that not only collects 
data but also educates users and contributes to a sustainable future. 
The focus is on innovative integration of existing AI models and datasets, not on training models 
from scratch. Given the 24-hour timeframe, prioritize a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with 
core functionalities over advanced features. 
3. Key Features & AI Integration Requirements 
Your "BioScout Islamabad" platform prototype should include the following core components as 
an MVP: 
A. Community Biodiversity Observation Hub: 
• Data Submission: A simple user-friendly interface for community members to submit 
biodiversity observations, including: 
• Species name (common or scientific, if known). 
• Date and location of observation (text input or basic map pin within Islamabad 
and areas like Margalla Hills National Park). 
• Option to upload an image of the observed species. 
• A "Notes" field for additional details (e.g., behavior, habitat). 
• Data Viewing: Display submitted observations as a list or on a simple interactive map of 
Islamabad and its environs (advanced filtering by species, date, or location is optional). 
• AI-Powered Species Identification (Assisted ID): 
• When a user uploads an image, integrate a pre-trained image recognition 
model/API to suggest potential species. 
• Clearly indicate this is an AI suggestion (confidence scores optional). 
• Use freely available models/APIs (e.g., via Hugging Face, iNaturalist API, 
TensorFlow Hub – check terms of use). If API integration is a barrier, mock the 
output with hardcoded suggestions and explain the intended approach. 
• Basic Gamification: Include a simple recognition mechanism, like a submission count or 
'Top Observer' badge (can be mock data for the prototype), to encourage community 
participation. 
B. RAG-Enhanced Biodiversity Q&A System: 
• Natural Language Queries: Allow users to ask questions about local biodiversity in plain 
English (e.g., "What birds are common in Margalla Hills?", "Are there recent sightings of 
leopards near Rawal Lake?"). 
• Knowledge Base for Retrieval: 
• Curated Documents: Create a small knowledge base of 3-5 text snippets (in .txt 
or .md format) about flora and fauna relevant to Islamabad and Margalla Hills, 
sourced from reliable online resources (a list of suggested sources like IWMB, 
WWF-Pakistan will be provided). 
• Observation Data Integration: Include textual components of community
submitted observations (e.g., species names, notes) in the searchable data. 
• Retrieval Mechanism: Implement a simple system to retrieve relevant text snippets from 
the knowledge base and observations based on the user’s query (e.g., keyword search or 
basic semantic search using pre-trained embeddings). 
• Augmented Generation: Use retrieved context to augment a prompt for a pre-trained 
Large Language Model (LLM) via a free API (e.g., Hugging Face Inference API, Google 
Gemini free tier – check availability). If API access is a hurdle, simulate the generation by 
preparing sample answers based on retrieved context and explain the intended 
integration. 
4. Dataset Requirements (To be created by participants) 
• Sample Biodiversity Observation Dataset: 
• Create a structured dataset (e.g., CSV format) with at least 10-15 fictional but 
plausible biodiversity observations from the Islamabad region (e.g., Margalla 
Hills, Rawal Lake). 
• Include fields like observation_id, species_name, common_name, 
date_observed, location (text or lat/long), image_url (placeholder), and 
descriptive notes. A template with 2-3 sample rows will be provided. 
• This dataset will initially populate and test your platform and RAG functionalities. 
Document your assumptions. 
• RAG Knowledge Base Documents: 
• Curate 3-5 text snippets about biodiversity relevant to Islamabad and 
surroundings. A sample snippet will be provided as a starting point. 
5. Technical Stack Guidance 
• Frontend: Your choice (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Streamlit for rapid 
prototyping). 
• Backend: Your choice (e.g., Python with Flask/Django, Node.js). 
• Database: Your choice (e.g., SQLite, Firebase, simple file-based storage for CSV). 
• AI Integration: 
• Species ID: Use existing pre-trained models/APIs (e.g., iNaturalist API, Hugging 
Face models). Mock outputs if integration is a barrier. 
• RAG: 
• Embeddings (for semantic search, if attempted): Libraries like Sentence 
Transformers. 
• Similarity Search: Simple keyword matching or tools like scikit-learn’s 
cosine_similarity. 
• LLMs (for generation): Free/developer-tier APIs (Hugging Face, Google 
Gemini). Simulate responses if needed. 
• Beginner Support: For teams new to AI, prioritize simple tools. Tutorials and fallbacks 
(e.g., hardcoded AI suggestions, keyword search for RAG) will be provided. No model 
training from scratch is expected—focus on API integration or simulation. 
• Inspiration: Look at platforms like iNaturalist for citizen science ideas, but your unique 
contribution is the locally focused knowledge base and AI-powered Q&A for Islamabad’s 
sustainability. 
6. Deliverables (24-Hour Hackathon) 
• Working Prototype: A deployed or locally runnable version of "BioScout Islamabad" 
demonstrating the MVP features. 
• Source Code: Access to complete source code (e.g., via Git repository). 
• Datasets: 
• Sample biodiversity observation CSV file (10-15 entries). 
• Collection of 3-5 text snippets for the RAG knowledge base. 
• Presentation & Demo (5-7 minutes): 
• Explain your platform’s architecture and core features (submission, AI ID, Q&A). 
• Demonstrate community observation submission, AI-assisted ID, and RAG Q&A 
with example queries relevant to Islamabad’s biodiversity. 
• Discuss data sources and how the RAG system works (or would work with an 
LLM). 
• Briefly (1-2 minutes) outline how "BioScout Islamabad" could scale or evolve to 
support conservation (e.g., integrating with national databases, partnering with 
NGOs). 
• Highlight challenges and potential improvements. 
7. Optional Enhancements for Extra Recognition 
Implement features beyond the MVP for additional consideration under "Innovation & User 
Experience" and potential special mentions (e.g., "Most Creative Feature"): 
• User accounts or advanced gamification for submitting observations. 
• Community validation of AI-suggested species IDs. 
• Advanced RAG (e.g., sophisticated embeddings or retrieval strategies). 
• Multilingual support for queries/content (e.g., Urdu). 
• Offline capabilities or Progressive Web App (PWA) for field use in areas like Margalla 
Hills.
